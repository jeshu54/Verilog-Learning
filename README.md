# Verilog-Learning
Verilog Files

I will be adding my verilog files with simulated results for anyone to understand how hardware design works on modelsim. I am learning this myself, so I would be happy if anyone feels like adding more learning material or correct me if I am wrong somewhere.


I will add a drive link which will contain more details on the components, simulations and steps, truth table logic and boolean expressions.
